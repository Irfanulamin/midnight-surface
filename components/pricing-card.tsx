 * a movement no other section uses — Our Work wipes, How It Works pans, the
 * headings assemble word by word. Pricing gets its own.
 *
 * Once the pair lands, each card's contents unpack in reading order — name,
 * blurb, price, CTA, then the feature rows cascading one by one. The cascade is
 * the point: the list is what the reader is actually buying, and drawing it in
 * row by row makes them read it instead of skimming a wall of ticks. Both cards
 * run identical interior timing, so they stay mirror images the whole way in.
 *
 * The entrance sits on a wrapper and `.lift` stays on the article beneath it.
 * They cannot share an element: Motion writes an inline transform, and an
 * inline transform beats the class, so putting both on the article silently
 * killed the hover lift.
