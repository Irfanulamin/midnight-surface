/*
 * Footer, from the bottom of Frame 1 (node 221:8193 + content 243:8287).
 *
 * One dark teal card (#286f6b — the same green the design uses for the section
 * label pills, deliberately lighter than --color-teal) inset 10px from the
 * viewport edges, with three decorative layers under the content:
 *
 *   1. a giant script "Surface" watermark (Brigitha Signature, a font the repo
 *      does not ship — exported as an image), cream at ~7% so it reads as a
 *      slightly lighter teal;
 *   2. the giant "Midnight" wordmark along the bottom edge, an SVG export of
 *      the vectorised text. In the design it is 1585px wide on a 1420px card
 *      (≈112%) and its bottom quarter runs off the card, so it is wider than
 *      its container and translated down, with the card's overflow crop doing
 *      the clipping;
 *   3. the content: logo, the oversized email, a hairline, then MENU / SOCIAL
 *      columns and the copyright.
 *
 * Same hash anchors as the header nav, rendered as plain <a> for the same
 * reason (Lenis owns in-page scrolling — see SmoothScroll). The social pills
 * point nowhere yet, like the routes the nav CTA references: no URLs exist for
 * this fictional studio.

        A full screen tall, and `dvh` rather than `vh` or `h-screen`: on mobile
        Safari `vh` is measured against the viewport WITHOUT the address bar, so
        a 100vh footer is taller than what you can actually see and the giant
        wordmark at its foot sits below the fold until the bar retracts. `min-h`
        rather than `h` so the footer can still grow past a screen if the links
        wrap on a short, narrow device instead of overflowing its own card.
      */}

          The whole bottom-of-card artwork in one asset: the teal script
          "Surface" and the giant cream "Midnight" already composited, and
          already cropped at the right edge the way the design masks it. It
          replaces what used to be two separately positioned images.

          It is a 4x export of the 1420x883 card, so at full width it lines up
          on its own — no bleed percentages to keep in step. Anchored to the
          bottom rather than stretched: the top third of the file is empty, and
          scaling by width keeps the letterforms in proportion instead of
          squashing them when the card is taller than the design's aspect.

          Behind the content on purpose. The script passes under the links in
          the design too; only the wordmark, which starts around two thirds
          down, sits clear of them.
        */}
        {/*
          It rises into place as the footer arrives. The artwork is already
          cropped by the card's bottom edge, so starting it lower and letting it
          settle reads as the wordmark coming up out of that edge rather than an
          image fading in.

          Slow, short and last. 2.4s over 34px, on a 0.35s delay so the links
          above settle first and the wordmark rises in behind them as the final
          beat. A wide shape covers ground fast even on a small offset, so the
          distance stays small and the duration does the smoothing; longer
          travel read as the wordmark overshooting rather than settling.
