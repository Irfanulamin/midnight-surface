/*
 * The step carousel: pinned pan, six cards with exactly one lit at a time, and
 * the design's pagination dots underneath. It owns the <HorizontalPan> rather
 * than being slotted into one, because the active index has to reach both the
 * cards (inside the panning track) and the dots (below it, not panning), and
 * that shared state needs a common client-side parent.
 *
 * The highlight used to be a hover state, so the steps only read as a sequence
 * if you dragged a cursor across them. It is driven by position now, so the
 * scrub itself walks the user through the process: each step lifts and turns
 * yellow as it takes the centre of the screen, and settles back as the next one
 * takes over.
 *
 * Nearest-to-centre rather than an IntersectionObserver band, because "one at a
 * time" cannot be expressed as a band. Cards sit on a 384px pitch with a 24px
 * gap, so any observer window wider than that gap catches two neighbours at
 * once, and any window narrower than it drops to zero while a gap crosses the
 * middle. Measuring distance to the centre has neither failure: there is always
 * exactly one winner.
 *
 * The axis flips at the same breakpoint the pan does: horizontal while pinned
 * at md and up, vertical once the cards stack.
 *
 * Cost is six getBoundingClientRect reads per scroll frame, and setState only
 * when the winner actually changes, so the tree re-renders once per step rather
 * than once per frame. This is the sanctioned way to read scroll — a raw
 * scroll listener is banned by the taste skill.

              No border and no shadow, active or not: in the Figma the active
              card is a flat yellow plane; the raise alone does the separating.

              The raise is the design's line-crossing move — at rest the cards
              sit 40px below the rule that ends the header (track mt-6 + this
              wrapper's pt-4), and the active card translates up 64px, putting
              its top edge 24px above the rule. In the Figma the geometry is
              50px below / 51px above on a 562px card; ours is scaled to the
              viewport-constrained card height. The track paints after the
              header, so the raised card covers the rule rather than sliding
              under it. Below md there is no rule to cross, so the lift stays
              at the subtle 12px.

              700ms, not the 500ms used elsewhere: this transition is the
              storytelling beat, so it wants to be seen rather than snapped
              through. The lift is gated behind motion-safe, leaving
              reduced-motion users the colour change, which carries the same
              information without moving anything.

              overflow-hidden on the card is a guard for short viewports, where
              the corner icon would otherwise spill past the rounded corner.
            */}
            {/*
              Values below are the Figma's own, not approximations: 30px card
              padding (70px on top), 16px label in #399e98 at 50%, 96px
              SemiBold number and 32px title in #286f6b at 50% (both turning
              #1c5a55 — the teal token — on the active card), a 64px gap
              between number and title, 18px body at 1.7 line height, and a
              120px icon in the bottom-right corner. The icon is in flow after
              an mt-auto, so on cards squeezed shorter than the design's 562px
              it clips at the bottom edge instead of colliding with the body.
              `pin-short` compresses type and gaps on pinned viewports that
              cannot fit the full-scale card — see globals.css.

              Size floors, climbing by breakpoint: 470px stacked, 510px once
              the pan takes over at md, and the design's 360x562 at lg.

              The `min(…, 100%)` is load-bearing and must not be simplified to
              a bare pixel floor. The pinned section is exactly 100dvh, so a
              card taller than its track does not make the section scroll — the
              overflow is simply never reachable, and what falls off the bottom
              is the icon, which sits last. A plain `min-h-[562px]` did exactly
              that on any viewport under ~1080px tall, and took the pagination
              dots below the fold with it.

              Capping the floor at 100% of the track keeps the design's size
              wherever it fits and quietly yields to the available height
              wherever it does not, so nothing is ever cropped. On a viewport
              tall enough for the full-size type (the `pin-short` cut-off at
              1079px) the track is already ~584px, so the 562px card is what
              you get there anyway — the clamp only ever engages on the screens
              where the alternative was a broken card.
