/*
 * The shared trigger, and the one place the reload behaviour lives.
 *
 * `useInView(once)` is the forward path — fires the first time the element
 * scrolls into view, exactly as `whileInView` did.
 *
 * The extra piece is `passed`. When the page is reloaded into the middle of
 * itself (scroll restoration, see SmoothScroll), everything above the landing
 * point was never scrolled through, so its entrance never fired — and a
 * reveal that starts at opacity 0 then just stays there reads as missing
 * content the moment the reader scrolls back up. Motion's observer reports
 * those elements as "not intersecting" (they are above the viewport) and
 * leaves them hidden.
 *
 * So on mount, any element already fully above the viewport is shown straight
 * away. It is off screen when it happens, so the reader never sees it animate;
 * by the time they scroll up to it, it has settled. The setState sits inside a
 * requestAnimationFrame callback, not the effect body, which is both correct
 * (measure after paint) and what keeps it clear of the set-state-in-effect
 * rule.
