 * Scroll-driven horizontal pan.
 *
 * On desktop the section pins at the top of the viewport, the inner track
 * scrubs sideways as the user scrolls, and once the track runs out the page
 * releases and continues to the next section.
 *
 * This is the one place GSAP earns its place over Motion: it needs real pinning
 * and scrubbing, which ScrollTrigger does natively and `whileInView` cannot.
 * Entry reveals elsewhere stay on Motion.
 *
 * Below md the pan is dropped entirely and the track becomes a plain vertical
 * stack. A pinned section that eats several screens of scroll is hostile on a
 * phone, and the cards are wider than the viewport anyway.
 *
 * Two details that break the desktop path if you get them wrong:
 *   - `start: "top top"` — anything else (e.g. "top center") begins the pan
 *     before the section is pinned, so the user sees the track already
 *     part-way across.
 *   - `end: "+=" + distance` — the scroll length must equal the horizontal
 *     travel, or the pan finishes early and the section sits pinned doing
 *     nothing.
