 * Global smooth scroll.
 *
 * Lenis intercepts wheel/touch input and eases the real window scroll position
 * toward the target, so everything already reading scroll — ScrollTrigger's pin
 * in <HorizontalPan>, Motion's useScroll in the header and <Parallax> — inherits
 * the smoothing for free. Nothing downstream needs to know Lenis exists.
 *
 * Three wiring details carry the whole thing:
 *
 *   1. autoRaf: false + gsap.ticker
 *      Lenis' own rAF loop and GSAP's ticker are two independent loops. Running
 *      both means the smoothed scroll position is written in one frame and read
 *      by ScrollTrigger in the next, and the pinned section visibly trails the
 *      cursor. Driving lenis.raf from the ticker collapses them into one frame.
 *
 *   2. lenis.on("scroll", ScrollTrigger.update)
 *      Lenis' easing keeps moving after the input stops. Without this,
 *      ScrollTrigger only samples on native scroll events and the horizontal
 *      pan stutters through the tail of every gesture.
 *
 *   3. lagSmoothing(0)
 *      GSAP normally clamps a long frame's delta to avoid a jump. Here that
 *      desyncs the ticker from Lenis' real elapsed time, which reads as the page
 *      lurching after any hitch. Lenis does its own interpolation, so the
 *      clamp is not wanted.

   * Two sections pin (Our Work, How It Works), and a pin adds a spacer roughly
   * as tall as the track it scrubs — several thousand px of document height
   * that exists only once ScrollTrigger has run, in an effect, after hydration.
   *
   * The browser restores the old scroll position before any of that, while the
   * document is still the short unpinned version. A position that was valid for
   * the pinned layout gets clamped to whatever currently fits, and "somewhere
   * in Pricing" clamps to "somewhere in Our Work". The pins are built a moment
   * later, the document grows, and the scroll stays where it was clamped. It
   * looks like a redirect; it is a restore measured against a document that did
   * not exist yet.
   *
   * The browser cannot win that race — its restore happens before the height it
   * needs is knowable. So the position is recorded here on the way out and
   * replayed on the way back in, once the pins exist and the height is real.
   * Restoration is set to manual purely to stop the browser attempting its own
   * broken version first; the position itself is preserved, not discarded.
   *
   * ScrollTrigger also keeps a record of scroll positions and reapplies it on
   * refresh, fighting the same fight, so clearScrollMemory drops it.
