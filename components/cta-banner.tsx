          Three layers, bottom up: the flat #28706d card, the grid, then the
          white gradient over the top of it.

          There was a fourth — the card colour rising from transparent, to fade
          the grid out toward the bottom — and it is gone on purpose. Ending at
          fully opaque #28706d, it did not fade the grid so much as erase it,
          and with the grid already at 10% there was nothing left to see. The
          white gradient does that job on its own: it is strongest at the top
          where it lifts the whole card, and thins toward the bottom, so the
          grid quietly loses contrast as it descends without being painted out.

          All of it paints below the content: the content div is positioned, so
          it comes after these in paint order regardless of anything else.

          The grid, a 4x export of the 1128x412 card — its aspect matches the
          card's exactly, so at the design size the spacing lands as drawn.
          `object-cover` rather than a stretch: the card's aspect moves with
          the viewport, and scaling the artwork proportionally and cropping the
          excess keeps the grid square, where filling would shear it into
          diamonds.
