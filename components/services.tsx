                      ArrowDownLeft the Figma draws for the open state, so the
                      design's two icons become one that travels between them.

                      The transitioned property is `rotate`, NOT `transform`.
                      Tailwind v4 compiles rotate-* to the standalone `rotate`
                      property so transforms can compose, which means
                      transition-[transform] never sees it and the icon snaps
                      round with no animation at all.
