        `isolate` makes this a stacking context so the quote mark's -z-10 stops
        here, behind the heading and the card but still in front of the
        section's cream. Without it the mark would drop behind the section
        background and disappear entirely.

        {/*
          The oversized quote mark behind the section (Figma node 86:10657 —
          two copies of the same comma, which is all the export contains).

          Measured against the CONTENT column, not the section. The design's
          content is 1128 wide inside a 1440 frame, and every figure below is a
          ratio of that 1128, so the mark caps with the column at 1160 instead
          of growing with the viewport — sized off the section it reached
          ~1470px on a 1920 display, half again the size it is drawn.

            group w 1101.5 / 1128            -> 97.6% of the column
            each  w 514.2  / 1101.5          -> 46.7% of the group
            gap     73.2   / 1101.5          ->  6.6% of the group
            bleed past the column's right edge, and the rise above its top,
            are translates of the mark's OWN size rather than offsets in px or
            in column-%, so the whole composition scales as one piece and holds
            at every width.

          The section is already `overflow-hidden`, which crops the bleed the
          way the mask does in Figma. The artwork is white at ~43% alpha in the
          file itself, so it needs no opacity here — over cream it resolves to
          the lighter cream in the design. It sits before the content in DOM
          order, so the content paints over it without needing a z-index.

          Tailwind compiles translate-* to the standalone `translate` property
          while Motion writes `transform`, so the resting offset here and the
          entry travel below compose instead of overwriting each other.
        */}
        {/*
          alt="" keeps both images out of the accessibility tree.

          -z-10 is load-bearing, not decoration. An absolutely positioned
          element paints ABOVE non-positioned block content in the same
          stacking context whatever the DOM order, so being written before the
          heading was not enough — the mark was laying its cream over the words
          and lifting their colour. Dropping it a layer puts it where it
          belongs, behind the text rather than tinting it.
        */}

          {/*
            Slow and late: the mark drifts in from the right well after the
            heading has assembled, over 1.6s, so it reads as the section
            settling rather than a graphic snapping in. The outer comma trails
            the inner by ~0.2s, so the pair opens outward toward the edge it
            bleeds off instead of arriving as one slab. 90px of travel — a wide
            shape covers ground fast, so the distance stays modest and the
            duration does the smoothing. Each is its own <Reveal>, so the two
            delays are absolute and independent.

            amount 0.1: the mark is mostly outside the section's overflow, so
            the observer only ever sees the sliver that is not clipped.
